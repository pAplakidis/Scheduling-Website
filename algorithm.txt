TODO: need to distribute them evenly as well (all days should try to have an equal number of classes)

ALL LECTURES LAST 3 HOURS EACH

for lecture in lectures:

  // check for the given classroom
  if the classroom that the teacher wants is available any day for the whole day:
    add lecture there
    continue
  else if the classroom is taken all days:
    for day in days:
      check for a day where the specific room is available for specific hour
      if found day and hour available for desired room and teacher:
        add lecture there
        continue
  else:
    // TODO: modify the following algorithm to work with the above (maybe?)

    // check for whatever classroom
    for day in days:
      if day is empty:
        add lecture if teacher is available that day
        break
    // if no day is empty
    for day in days:
      if there is an empty room for the day:
        add class in this day
        break
      else (all rooms are taken for specific hours today):
        find a suitable hour where the teacher and the room are available at the same time
        add lecture in this day
        break

  if nothing is available for no day:
    print "Cannot add lecture.title to the schedule"
